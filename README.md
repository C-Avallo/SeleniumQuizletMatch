# SeleniumQuizletMatch
A way for selenium webdriver to play match on quizlet. This is a project to help learn how selenium webdriver works, not to mess around on quizlet. That's not very cool. It averages about 5 seconds a match, if your computer is pretty good. It is just made to work.

### Dependencies

To function correctly, please install the following dependencies: [python3], pyautogui, etc. 

## How to Use:

To use the bot: Download the quizlet set as a txt file. Use a semicolon to seperate answers for questions. The bot will read the answers and the questions and put them into an array. When it activates, it reads from the array and checks for that text on the screen, using that text to click on the correct answer. Warning: Sometimes Quizlet does not actually process the clicks because of the bot's speed.
