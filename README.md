# SeleniumQuizletMatch
A way for selenium webdriver to play match on quizlet. This is a project to help learn how selenium webdriver works, not to mess around on quizlet. That's not very cool. This bot is not about speed. It averages about 5 seconds a match, if your computer is pretty good. It is just made to work. 

To function correctly, please install the following dependencies: [python3], pyautogui, etc. Also, fill in your own paths in the files. This requires a bit of common sense.
